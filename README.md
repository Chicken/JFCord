# MBCord

## MBCord is an open-source Discord rich presence client for the [Emby](https://emby.media/)/[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) media server

#### Version 1.0.7 is finally here. This version includes Jellyfin support, less spammy logs and more!

- To switch to jellyfin mode, you must go to the configuration page and click the "Switch to Jellyfin" button in the bottom left.   
    - If you already configured and want to switch to Jellyfin, you can Right Click Tray Icon -> Reset App to return to the configuration page.

- To access additional features such as resetting configuration, running at startup and more, you can simply right click the tray icon (MBCord must be configured to access the tray icon)

## I am aware of how buggy this is, it will be remade some time in the future
