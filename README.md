# EmbyCord

EmbyCord is an open-source Discord rich presence client for the [Emby](https://emby.media/) media server

Major rewrite coming up in the future. Better logging, better code, less resource-intensive

I am aware that this project is quite sloppy since I developed it in a rush, and since I've stopped using Emby for a little while to explore some other options I haven't spent any time on this project. Do not worry, this project isn't abandoned, I just haven't worked on it in a while.
